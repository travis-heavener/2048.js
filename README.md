### Remake by Travis Heavener

## About

A JavaScript remake of the classic 2048, which I've been toying with creating properly since 2018.

I had initially made a basic version of 2048 (with some bugs) back in 2018, and have since been intending to make a new version that works as intended.

This version is fully polished to replicate the original 2048 feel and color scheme, as well as the UI layout.

This project uses localStorage to store the user's best score, nothing fancy, given I was aiming to complete the entire thing in under 10 hours of working time (which I did).
